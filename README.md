# Python-Software-related-questions
Question 1 - Have you ever worked on any networking related program (whether in python or any other language). Networking means working with TCP/UDP.

Answer- no, not yet. TCP socket creation is what I am looking forward to work on.

Question 2 - Do you have any knowledge or experience with SIP (session initiation protocol). Again this experience does not necessarily need to be in python.

Answer- I have basic knowledge regarding SIP as it was in my course in computer networking. However, I havenâ€™t implemented it in any programming language yet.

Question 3 - Do you have knowledge of databases (either NoSQL or SQL). Which ones?
Answer- yes, I have studied SQL and have complete knowledge about the commands associated to it.

Question 4 - Have you ever worked with an ORM like sqlalchemy/mongoengine in python.
Answer- no but I have worked on postgresql.

Question 5 - Have you ever worked with any microservices/web-based frameworks in python (like Flask/Sanic/Django).
Answer- yes, Django. I have created website using Django and still working on this to improve my skills.

Question 6 - Have you ever used any concurrency framework like asyncio/gevents/twisted in python? If yes, which ones.
Answer- NO. I have no idea about this.
